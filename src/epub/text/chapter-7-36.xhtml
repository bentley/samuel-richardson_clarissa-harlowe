					</header>
					<p>Your pert letter I have received. You, that spare nobody, I cannot expect should spare me. You are very happy in a prudent and watchful mother.⁠—But else mine cannot be exceeded in prudence; but we had all too good an opinion of somebody, to think watchfulness needful. There may possibly be some reason why you are so much attached to her in an error of this flagrant nature.</p>
					<p>I help to make a sister unhappy!⁠—It is false, Miss!⁠—It is all her own doings!⁠—except, indeed, what she may owe to somebody’s advice⁠—you know who can best answer for that.</p>
					<p>Let us <em>know your mind</em> as soon as you please: as we shall know it to be your mind, we shall judge what attention to give it. That’s all, from, <abbr>etc.</abbr></p>
