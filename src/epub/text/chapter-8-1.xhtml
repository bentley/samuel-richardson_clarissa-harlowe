				<p>MY DEAREST CREATURE,</p>
				<p>I can write but just now a few lines. I cannot tell how to bear the sound of that Mr. Belford for your executor, cogent as your reasons for that measure are: and yet I am firmly of opinion, that none of your relations should be named for the trust. But I dwell the less on this subject, as I hope (and cannot bear to apprehend the contrary) that you will still live many, many years.</p>
				<p>Mr. Hickman, indeed, speaks very handsomely of Mr. Belford. But he, poor man! has not much penetration.â€”If he had, he would hardly think so well of me as he does.</p>
				<p>I have a particular opportunity of sending this by a friend of my aunt Harman's; who is ready to set out for London, (and this occasions my hurry,) and is to return out of hand. I expect therefore, by him a large packet from you; and hope and long for news of your amended health: which Heaven grant to the prayers of</p>
				<p>Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.</p>
