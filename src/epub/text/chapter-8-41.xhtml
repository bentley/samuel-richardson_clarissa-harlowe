					<p>Worthy Sir, My Very Good Friend and Patron,</p>
					<p>I arrived in town yesterday, after a tolerably pleasant journey (considering the hot weather and dusty roads). I put up at the Bull and Gate in Holborn, and hastened to Covent-garden. I soon found the house where the unhappy lady lodgeth. And, in the back shop, had a good deal of discourse* with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smith, (her landlady,) whom I found to be so <strong>highly prepossessed</strong>** in her <strong>favour,</strong> that I saw it would not answer your desires to take my informations <strong>altogether</strong> from her: and being obliged to attend my patron, (who to my sorrow,</p>

					</blockquote>
					<p>I find wanteth much waiting upon, and is <strong>another</strong> sort of man than he was at college: for, Sir, <strong>inter nos,</strong> <strong>honours change manners.</strong> For the <strong>aforesaid causes,</strong> I thought it would best answer all the ends of the commission with which you honoured me, to engage, in the desired scrutiny, the wife of a <strong>particular friend,</strong> who liveth almost over-against the house where she lodgeth, and who is a gentlewoman of <strong>character,</strong> and <strong>sobriety,</strong> a <strong>mother of children,</strong> and one who <strong>knoweth</strong> the <strong>world</strong> well.</p>
					<p>To her I applied myself, therefore, and gave her a short history of the case, and desired she would very particularly inquire into the <strong>conduct</strong> of the unhappy young lady; her <strong>present way of life</strong> and <strong>subsistence</strong>; her <strong>visitors,</strong> her <strong>employments,</strong> and suchlike: for these, Sir, you know, are the things whereof you wished to be informed.</p>
					<p>Accordingly, Sir, I waited upon the gentlewoman aforesaid, this day; and, to <strong>my</strong> very great trouble, (because I know it will be to <strong>your</strong>s,” and likewise to all your worthy family’s,) I must say, that I do find things look a little more <strong>darkly</strong> than I hoped the would. For, alas! Sir, the gentlewoman’s report turneth out not so <strong>favourable</strong> for Miss’s reputation, as <strong>I</strong> wished, as <strong>you</strong> wished, and as <strong>everyone</strong> of her friends wished. But so it is throughout the world, that <strong>one false step</strong> generally brings on <strong>another</strong>; and peradventure <strong>a worse,</strong> and <strong>a still worse</strong>; till the poor <strong>limed soul</strong> (a very fit epithet of the Divine Quarles’s!) is quite <strong>entangled,</strong> and (without infinite mercy) lost forever.</p>
					<p>It seemeth, Sir, she is, notwithstanding, in a very <strong>ill state of health.</strong> In this, <strong>both</strong> gentlewomen (that is to say, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smith, her landlady, and my friend’s wife) agree. Yet she goeth often out in a chair, to <strong>prayers</strong> (as it is said). But my friend’s wife told me, that nothing is more common in London, than that the frequenting of the church at morning prayers is made the <strong>pretence</strong> and <strong>cover</strong> for <strong>private assignations.</strong> What a sad thing is this! that what was designed for <strong>wholesome nourishment</strong> to the <strong>poor soul,</strong> should be turned into <strong>rank poison!</strong> But as <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Daniel de Foe (an ingenious man, though a <strong>dissenter</strong>) observeth (but indeed it is an old proverb; only I think he was the first that put it into verse)</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>God never had a house of pray’r But Satan had a chapel there.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Yet to do the lady <strong>justice,</strong> nobody cometh home with her: nor indeed <strong>can</strong> they, because she goeth forward and backward in a <strong>sedan,</strong> or <strong>chair,</strong> (as they call it). But then there is a gentleman of <strong>no good character</strong> (an <strong>intimado</strong> of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace) who is a <strong>constant</strong> visitor of her, and of the people of the house, whom he <strong>regaleth</strong> and <strong>treateth,</strong> and hath (of consequence) their <strong>high good words.</strong></p>
					<p>I have thereupon taken the trouble (for I love to be <strong>exact</strong> in any <strong>commission</strong> I undertake) to inquire <strong>particularly</strong> about this <strong>gentleman,</strong> as he is called (albeit I hold no man so but by his actions: for, as Juvenal saith,</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>—Nobilitas sola est, atque unica virtus</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And this I did <strong>before</strong> I would sit down to write to you.</p>
					<p>His name is Belford. He hath a paternal estate of upwards of one thousand pounds by the year; and is now in mourning for an uncle who left him very considerably besides. He beareth a very profligate character as to <strong>women,</strong> (for I inquired particularly about <strong>that,</strong>) and is <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s more especial <strong>privado,</strong> with whom he holdeth a <strong>regular correspondence</strong>; and hath been often seen with Miss (tÃªte Ã tÃªte) at the <strong>window</strong>⁠—in no <strong>bad way,</strong> indeed: but my friend’s wife is of opinion that all is not <strong>as it should be.</strong> And, indeed, it is mighty strange to me, if Miss be so <strong>notable a penitent</strong> (as is represented) and if she have such an <strong>aversion</strong> to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace, that she will admit his <strong>privado</strong> into <strong>her retirements,</strong> and see <strong>no other company.</strong></p>
					<p>I understand, from <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smith, that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hickman was to see her some time ago, from Miss Howe; and I am told, by <strong>another</strong> hand, (you see, Sir, how diligent I have been to execute the <strong>commissions</strong> you gave me,) that he had no <strong>extraordinary opinion</strong> of this Belford at first; though they were seen together one morning by the opposite neighbour, at <strong>breakfast</strong>: and another time this Belford was observed to <strong>watch</strong> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hickman’s coming from her; so that, as it should seem, he was mighty zealous to <strong>ingratiate</strong> himself with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Hickman; no doubt to engage him to make a <strong>favourable report to Miss Howe</strong> of the <strong>intimacy</strong> he was admitted into by her unhappy friend; who (<strong>as she is very ill</strong>) may <strong>mean no harm</strong> in allowing his visits, (for he, it seemeth, brought to her, or recommended, at least, the doctor and apothecary that attend her:) but I think (upon the whole) <strong>it looketh not well.</strong></p>
					<p>I am sorry, Sir, I cannot give you a better account of the young lady’s <strong>prudence.</strong> But, what shall we say?</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>Uvaque conspectâ livorem ducit ab uvâ,</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>as Juvenal observeth.</p>
					<p>One thing I am afraid of; which is, that Miss may be under <strong>necessities</strong>; and that this Belford (who, as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Smith owns, hath <strong>offered her money,</strong> which she, <strong>at the time,</strong> refused) may find an opportunity to <strong>take advantage</strong> of those <strong>necessities</strong>: and it is well observed by that poet, that</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>Aegrè formosam poteris servare puellam: Nunc prece, nunc pretio, forma petita ruit.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And this Belford (who is a <strong>bold man,</strong> and hath, as they say, the <strong>look</strong> of one) may make good that of Horace, (with whose writings you are so well acquainted; nobody better;)</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>Audax omnia perpeti, Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Forgive me, Sir, for what I am going to write: but if you could prevail upon the rest of your family to join in the scheme which <strong>you,</strong> and her <strong>virtuous sister,</strong> Miss Arabella, and the Archdeacon, and I, once talked of, (which is to persuade the unhappy young lady to go, in some <strong>creditable</strong> manner, to some one of the foreign colonies,) it might not save only her <strong>own credit</strong> and <strong>reputation,</strong> but the <strong>reputation</strong> and <strong>credit</strong> of all her <strong>family,</strong> and a great deal of <strong>vexation</strong> moreover. For it is my humble opinion, that you will hardly (any of you) enjoy yourselves while this (<strong>once</strong> innocent) young lady is in the way of being so frequently heard of by you: and this would put her <strong>out of the way</strong> both of <strong>this Belford</strong> and of <strong>that Lovelace,</strong> and it might, peradventure, prevent as much <strong>evil</strong> as <strong>scandal.</strong></p>
					<p>You will forgive me, Sir, for this my <strong>plainness.</strong> Ovid pleadeth for me,</p>
					<blockquote class="quotation">
						<p>—Adulator nullus amicus erit.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And I have no view but that of approving myself a <strong>zealous well-wisher</strong> to <strong>all</strong> your worthy family, (whereto I owe a great number of obligations,) and very particularly, Sir,</p>
					<p>Your obliged and humble servant, Elias Brand.</p>
					<p>Wedn. <abbr>Aug.</abbr> 9.</p>
					<p><abbr>P.S.</abbr>: I shall give you <strong>farther hints</strong> when I come down, (which will be in a few days;) and who my <strong>informants</strong> were; but by <strong>these</strong> you will see, that I have been very assiduous (for the time) in the task you set me upon.</p>
					<p>The <strong>length</strong> of my letter you will excuse: for I need not tell you, Sir, what <strong>narrative,</strong> <strong>complex,</strong> and <strong>conversation</strong> letters (such a one as <strong>mine</strong>) require. Everyone to his <strong>talent.</strong> <strong>Letter-writing</strong> is mine. I will be bold to say; and that my <strong>correspondence</strong> was much coveted in the university, on that account, by <strong>tyros,</strong> and by <strong>sophs,</strong> when I was hardly a <strong>soph</strong> myself. But this I should not have taken upon myself to mention, but only in defence of the <strong>length</strong> of my letter; for nobody writeth <strong>shorter</strong> or <strong>pithier,</strong> when the subject requireth <strong>common forms</strong> only⁠—but, in apologizing for my <strong>prolixity,</strong> I am <strong>adding</strong> to the <strong>fault,</strong> (if it were one, which, however, I cannot think it to be, the <strong>subject</strong> considered: but this I have said before in other words:) so, Sir, if you will excuse my <strong>postscript,</strong> I am sure you will not find fault with my <strong>letter.</strong></p>
					<p>One word more as to a matter of <strong>erudition,</strong> which you greatly love to hear me <strong>start</strong> and <strong>dwell upon.</strong> <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Lewen once, in <strong>your</strong> presence, (as you, <strong>my good patron,</strong> cannot but remember,) in a <strong>smartish</strong> kind of debate between <strong>him</strong> and <strong>me,</strong> took upon him to censure the <strong>paranthetical</strong> style, as I call it. He was a very learned and judicious man, to be sure, and an ornament to <strong>our function</strong>: but yet I must needs say, that it is a style which I greatly like; and the good Doctor was then past his <strong>youth,</strong> and that time of life, of consequence, when a <strong>fertile imagination,</strong> and a <strong>rich fancy,</strong> pour in ideas so fast upon a writer, that parentheses are often wanted (and that for the sake of <strong>brevity,</strong> as well as <strong>perspicuity</strong>) to save the reader the trouble of reading a passage <strong>more than once.</strong> Every man to his talent, (as I said before.) We are all so apt to set up our <strong>natural biases</strong> for <strong>general standards,</strong> that I wondered <strong>the less</strong> at the worthy Doctor’s <strong>stiffness</strong> on this occasion. He <strong>smiled at me,</strong> you may remember, Sir⁠—and, whether I was right or not, I am sure I <strong>smiled at him.</strong> And <strong>you,</strong> my <strong>worthy patron,</strong> (as I had the satisfaction to observe,) seemed to be of <strong>my party.</strong> But was it not strange, that the <strong>old gentleman</strong> and <strong>I</strong> should so widely differ, when the <strong>end</strong> with <strong>both</strong> (that is to say, <strong>perspicuity</strong> or <strong>clearness,</strong>) was the same?⁠—But what shall we say?⁠—<strong>Errare est hominis, sed non persistere.</strong></p>
					<p>I think I have nothing to add until I have the honour of attending you in <strong>person</strong>; but I am, (as above,) <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr>etc.</abbr></p>
