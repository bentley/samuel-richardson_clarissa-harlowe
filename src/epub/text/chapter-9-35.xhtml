				<p>MR. BELFORD, TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD M. LONDON, SEPT. 14.</p>
				<p>MY LORD,</p>
				<p>I am very apprehensive that the affair between Mr. Lovelace and the late excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe will be attended with farther bad consequences, notwithstanding her dying injunctions to the contrary. I would, therefore, humbly propose that your Lordship, and his other relations, will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad; where I hope he will stay till all is blown over. But as he will not stir, if he knew the true motives of your wishes, the avowed inducement, as I hinted once to Mr. Mowbray, may be such as respects his own health both of person and mind. To Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville all countries are alike; and they perhaps will accompany him.</p>
				<p>I am glad to hear that he is in a way of recovery; but this the rather induces me to press the matter. I think no time should be lost.</p>
				<p>Your Lordship had head that I have the honour to be the executor of this admirable lady's last will. I transcribe from it the following paragraph.</p>
				<pre xml:space="preserve">[He then transcribes the article which so gratefully mentions this nobleman, and the ladies of his family, in relation to the rings she bequeaths them, about which he desires their commands.] </pre>
