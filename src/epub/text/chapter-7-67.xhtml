						<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">Thursday Morning, <time datetime="1738-08-03"><abbr>Aug.</abbr> 3</time>. Six o’clock</p>
					</header>
					<p>I have been so much employed in my own and Belton’s affairs, that I could not come to town till last night; having contented myself with sending to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lovick, to know, from time to time, the state of the lady’s health; of which I received but very indifferent accounts, owing, in a great measure, to letters or advices brought her from her implacable family.</p>
					<p>I have now completed my own affairs; and, next week, shall go to Epsom, to endeavour to put Belton’s sister into possession of his own house for him: after which, I shall devote myself wholly to your service, and to that of the lady.</p>
					<p>I was admitted to her presence last night; and found her visibly altered for the worse. When I went home, I had your letter of Tuesday last put into my hands. Let me tell thee, Lovelace, that I insist upon the performance of thy engagement to me that thou wilt not personally molest her.</p>
					<p class="abstract">(<abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belford dates again on Thursday morning, ten o’clock; and gives an account of a conversation which he had just held with the Lady upon the subject of Miss Montague’s letter to her, preceding, and upon <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lovelace’s alternatives, as mentioned in Letter LXV., which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belford supported with the utmost earnestness. But, as the result of this conversation will be found in the subsequent letters, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Belford’s pleas and arguments in favour of his friend, and the Lady’s answers, are omitted.)</p>
