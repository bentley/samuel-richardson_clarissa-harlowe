					<p>Miss Harlowe,</p>
					<p>I cannot help acquainting you (however it may be received, coming from <em>me</em>) that your poor sister is dangerously ill, at the house of one Smith, who keeps a gloverâ€™s and perfume shop, in King-street, Covent-garden. She knows not that I write. Some violent words, in the nature of an imprecation, from her father, afflict her greatly in her weak state. I presume not to direct you what to do in this case. You are her sister. I therefore could not help writing to you, not only for her sake, but for your own. I am, Madam,</p>
					<p>Your humble servant, Anna Howe.</p>
