				<p>I went out early this morning, and returned not till just now; when I was informed that my beloved, in my absence, had taken it into her head to attempt to get away.</p>
				<p>She tripped down, with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief, her hood on; and was actually in the entry, when Mrs. Sinclair saw her.</p>
				<p>Pray, Madam, whipping between her and the street-door, be pleased to let me know where you are going?</p>
				<p>Who has a right to controul me? was the word.</p>
				<p>I have, Madam, by order of your spouse: and, kemboing her arms, as she owned, I desire you will be pleased to walk up again.</p>
				<p>She would have spoken; but could not: and, bursting into tears, turned back, and went up to her chamber: and Dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before she was seen.</p>
				<p>This shows, as we hoped last night, that she is recovering her charming intellects.</p>
				<p>Dorcas says, she was visible to her but once before the whole day; and then she seemed very solemn and sedate.</p>
				<p>I will endeavour to see her. It must be in her own chamber, I suppose; for she will hardly meet me in the dining-room. What advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of her’s, if she be recovered!⁠—I, the most confident of men: she, the most delicate of women. Sweet soul! methinks I have her before me: her face averted: speech lost in sighs⁠—abashed⁠—conscious⁠—what a triumphant aspect will this give me, when I gaze on her downcast countenance!</p>
				<p>***</p>
				<p>This moment Dorcas tells me she believes she is coming to find me out. She asked her after me: and Dorcas left her, drying her red-swoln eyes at her glass; [no design of moving me by tears!] sighing too sensibly for my courage. But to what purpose have I gone thus far, if I pursue not my principal end? Niceness must be a little abated. She knows the worst. That she cannot fly me; that she must see me; and that I can look her into a sweet confusion; are circumstances greatly in my favour. What can she do but rave and exclaim? I am used to raving and exclaiming⁠—but, if recovered, I shall see how she behaves upon this our first sensible interview after what she has suffered.</p>
				<p>Here she comes.</p>
