				<p>DEAR MISS HOWE,</p>
				<p>Your letter has infinitely disturbed us all.</p>
				<p>This wretched man has been half distracted ever since Saturday night.</p>
				<p>We knew not what ailed him, till your letter was brought.</p>
				<p>Vile wretch, as he is, he is however innocent of this new evil.</p>
				<p>Indeed he is, he must be; as I shall more at large acquaint you.</p>
				<p>But will not now detain your messenger.</p>
				<p>Only to satisfy your just impatience, by telling you, that the dear young lady is safe, and we hope well.</p>
				<p>A horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected her to the terror and disgrace of an arrest.</p>
				<p>Poor dear Miss Harlowe!â€”Her sufferings have endeared her to us, almost as much as her excellencies can have endeared her to you.</p>
				<p>But she must now be quite at liberty.</p>
				<p>He has been a distracted man, ever since the news was brought him; and we knew not what ailed him.</p>
				<p>But that I said before.</p>
				<p>My Lord M. my lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance, will all write to you this very afternoon.</p>
				<p>And so will the wretch himself.</p>
				<p>And send it by a servant of their own, not to detain your's.</p>
				<p>I know not what I write.</p>
				<p>But you shall have all the particulars, just, and true, and fair, from</p>
				<p>Dear Madam, Your most faithful and obedient servant, CH. MONTAGUE.</p>
